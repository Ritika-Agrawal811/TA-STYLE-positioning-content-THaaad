          In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In
          our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storeroom,
          our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our
          ships and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets and other
          places too numerous to mention, how useful they are!In our ships,
          however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still they are of great
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
          awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is
          their home!How well Shakespeare in Pericles,Act iii., describes this
          keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          The cat, with eyne of burning coal,Now crouches from(before) the
          mouse's hole.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick,sharp, resolute
          motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a
          plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered
          therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and lind
          regard for them.
